TS-Λ3 // MASTER ARCHITECTURAL MANIFEST  
Version: v9.0.0  

Authority: THE OVERWATCH // ENGINEER ELDER  
Mission: Complete Functional & Spatial Substrate Breakdown  
Status: AUTHORITATIVE // LATCHED  
Standard: SMALLCAPS MANDATE // NAMESPACE FISSION

## 1. THE SPATIAL STACK (L0–L4)

The Mothership is architected as a vertical reasoning plane, modeled after the C4 Spatial Stack. This allows the system to maintain context across high-stakes transitions.

- **L0 – THE FIRM (Temporal Anchor)**  
  Nodes: Overwatch (Human), The Library (Intel), The Elders (Council).  
  Role: Root of authority and historical state.

- **L1 – COMMAND PLANE (Sovereign Root)**  
  Nodes: RPR COMMUNICATIONS LLC, Sentinel Protocol.  
  Role: Legal and technical routing layer that enforces the Burden of Intent.

- **L2 – THE ELDERS (Reasoning Plane)**  
  Nodes: Architect (Perplexity), Engineer (Gemini), Sentinel (Governance).  
  Role: Strategic intelligence design and drift monitoring.

- **L3 – THE WORKSHOP (Execution Layer)**  
  Nodes: Labs (Planning), Forge (Build), Daedalus (Learning).  
  Role: Operational substrate where missions are transformed into code and artifacts.

- **L4 – SPECIALIST INSTANCES (Product Layer)**  
  Nodes: MYΛUDIT (Accounting), RPR VERIFY (Compliance), ICARUS (Copilot).  
  Role: Tenant-facing surfaces and specialized AI business units.

## 2. TECHNICAL SUBSTRATE

The implementation is built on a high-fidelity modern web stack optimized for speed and clinical precision.

- Runtime: React 18 + Vite (ESM mode).  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (integrated via Vite plugin).  
- Icons: Material Symbols Outlined (ligature-protected via SymbolTile v5.4.2).  
- Diagrams: Mermaid.js (client-side rendering for architectural transparency).  
- Database: Firebase Firestore (WORM ledger for IP provenance).  
- Payments: Stripe V3 engine with a dual-stage “Hibernation” gate.

## 3. LINGUISTIC FISSION (i18n)

To prevent narrative drift, the application uses two distinct translation namespaces, separated by residency:

| Namespace             | Focus                               | Physical residency                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `harbora`             | Brand narrative, nav, hero acts    | `/public/locales/{lang}/harbora.json`              |
| `mothershipwhitepaper` | 382-line technical specs, RAM     | `/src/locales/{lang}/mothershipwhitepaper.json`    |

***

## 4. GOVERNANCE & IP MOATS

The system architecture includes non-standard “moat” conditions to protect RPR Communications’ trade secrets and operational know-how.

- **RAM (Relational Accountability Model)**: Governance defined by bonds (e.g. Founder ↔ Organization) rather than model-level “safety” settings.  
- **Sentinel Protocol**: External law engine enforcing ConstraintSets at runtime so AI agents cannot drift outside their defined AgentContracts.  
- **WORM Ledger**: Write-once-read-many logging where every tactical strike (deployment) and strategic document hash is recorded to prove Point of Origin (POO).  
- **Air Gap**: Strategic governance files (IP-ARTIFACT-INDEX.md, etc.) are kept in `/OS/` or `/securevault/` and strictly excluded from the `src/` build bundle.

***

## 5. PHYSICAL RESIDENCY (Smallcaps Mandate)

To resolve the “wrong build” issue on Linux-based production servers, all core files follow strict lowercase normalization:

- `src/app.tsx` – authoritative orchestrator  
- `src/main.tsx` – entry point  
- `src/i18n/i18n.ts` – namespace latch  
- `public/checkout.html` – financial intake
