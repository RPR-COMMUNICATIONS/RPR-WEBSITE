## 🛠️ 1. FUNCTIONAL SCOPE
The Sentinel Protocol is the routing and enforcement layer that stands between the Human Intent and AI Execution. It prevents "Model Drift" by decoupling governance from model weights. It acts as the non-negotiable gatekeeper ensuring every agent interaction complies with the Relational Accountability Model (RAM).

## 🧬 2. DATA INGESTION (SentinelContextInput)
Every request to the Mothership must include the following telemetric latch to compute the ephemeral constraint envelope:
- **tenantId:** Unique identifier for the business entity to ensure data isolation.
- **geoProfile:** Points the decision logic to the Singapore Node (asia-southeast1) or specific regional jurisdictions.
- **tsClass:** Classification level (e.g., TS-3 Strategic, TS-Λ3 Classified) defining access depth.
- **moduleSet:** Defines which AI specialists (L4 Instances) are active and authorized for the session.

## 🛡️ 3. AGENT CONTRACTS
Sentinel issues temporary AgentContracts at runtime. These contracts are the mechanical manifestation of RBAA and define:
- **AllowedActions:** Strictly enumerated capabilities (e.g., READ_LEDGER, DRAFT_PRD).
- **ForbiddenActions:** Hard-locks on system variables and protected files (e.g., MODIFY_ROOT_CONFIG).
- **EscalationPath:** The specific human (Overwatch) or Elder required to approve a VETO break or high-risk action.

## 📊 4. FORENSIC TELEMETRY (C-STRIDE)
Sentinel streams every decision to the C-STRIDE pipeline for longitudinal analysis:
- **Latency:** Time-to-latch (target < 20ms).
- **Drift Score:** Variance between the human's strategic intent and the agent's tactical output.
- **Audit Marker:** SHA-256 hash of the final artifact anchored to the POO Ledger.
