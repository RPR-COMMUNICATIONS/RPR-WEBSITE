## 0. Abstract & Claims

The Mothership OS is a business operating system designed to synchronize a legal entity with its digital state (Living Digital Twin). The system uses the Relational Accountability Model (RAM) to govern Human–AI interactions through a deterministic five-layer (L0–L4) hierarchy. Unlike internal model alignment strategies (Constitutional AI), the Mothership OS enforces governance through external ConstraintSets and AgentContracts computed at runtime.

**Core claims**

- **Relational vs. Constitutional**: Governance is defined by relational bonds and mutual obligations rather than abstract model moralities.  
- **Clinical sovereignty**: Technical enforcement via the Sentinel Protocol ensures time/place latching for every agent action.  
- **Forensic learning**: A closed-loop RLHF system (Daedalus) transforms human decisions into operational patterns.

## 1. The Sovereign Bond Stack

The Sovereign Bond Stack is the mechanical implementation of RAM, defining the flow of authority, obligation, and liability between nodes.

### 1.1 The five foundational bonds

- Founder ↔ Organization: Primary Authority Latch; the Founder retains the Burden of Intent, the Organization carries the Burden of Context.  
- Founder ↔ Stewards (Elders): Delegated Tactical Authority; Elders interpret mission lines within specific domains with a technical mandate for risk escalation.  
- Senior ↔ Junior: Supervisory Liability; higher-tier nodes are accountable for lower-tier outputs via PROCEED/VETO validation loops.  
- Peer ↔ Peer: Horizontal Synchronization; agents of the same tier coordinate via compatible ConstraintSets to prevent domain collision.  
- All ↔ Source of Truth: Forensic Anchor; all system states must align with audited external data (ledgers, statutes, forensic evidence).

### 1.2 Role-Based Agent Authority (RBAA)

RBAA is the permissions substrate that translates RAM bonds into concrete data and action scopes.

- Spatial-latched: Every decision is validated against Harbor, Tenant, and Jurisdiction.  
- Temporal-latched: Decisions are tied to a mission sequence and timestamp, preventing context-blind drift.

## 2. The Sentinel Protocol

The Sentinel Protocol is the technical law engine of the Mothership OS, governing how work is authorized and routed within the corporate sovereign.

### 2.1 Jurisdiction & logic

Sentinel computes ConstraintSets using the `SentinelContextInput` (tenantId, productMode, moduleSet, industryProfile, geoProfile, tsClass). It issues AgentContracts that bind specific roles to finite scopes (collections, APIs, allowedActions) and writes every significant action into GovernanceSessions.

### 2.2 External constraint enforcement

By keeping constraints external to model weights, Sentinel eliminates the opacity of vendor-unilateralism. The governance structure lives outside any single model and is only amendable via formal KONTROL changes approved by Overwatch.

## 3. Intelligence Substrate

### 3.1 The Library

Authoritative knowledgebase substrate for proven patterns. It does not compute constraints but provides shared memory for L3/L4 agents.

### 3.2 Daedalus RLHF

Monitors GovernanceSessions for human PROCEED/VETO signals and converts interaction pairs into curated training data for model fine-tuning and pattern curation.

### 3.3 ICARUS Advisory

Tenant-scoped copilot with read-only governance access. It explains constraints to the human owner and shapes mission briefs for the build pipelines.

### 3.4 QFD Strategic Modules

Uses Quality Function Deployment to map the “Voice of the Human” to technical behavior, ensuring capabilities are driven by real-world SME requirements.

***

## 4. The Mothership OS Architecture

The system operates across a five-layer hierarchical stack:

- L0 – THE FIRM: Organizational root mapping core legal roles and the sovereign root.  
- L1 – COMMAND PLANE: Human intent layer where THE OVERWATCH establishes strategic lines.  
- L2 – THE ELDERS: Strategic intelligence and governance design (Sentinel, Architect, Engineer).  
- L3 – THE WORKSHOP: Operational substrate for execution and learning (Labs, Forge, Daedalus).  
- L4 – SPECIALIST INSTANCES: Tenant-facing surfaces and industry-specific agents (MYAUDIT, VERIFY).

## 5. Sovereign Deployment & IP

### 5.1 Infrastructure posture

The system is point-locked to the asia-southeast1 region. Access is governed via Workload Identity Federation (WIF v2), ensuring a zero-trust posture.

### 5.2 Forensic provenance

Every IP-significant artifact is hashed (SHA-256) and recorded in a Firestore WORM Ledger to prove Point of Origin (POO) and version integrity.

## 6. Appendix: RAM vs. Constitutional AI

| Metric         | Constitutional AI                | Relational Accountability (RAM)                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Enforcement    | Internal model prompting         | External ConstraintSet + AgentContract              |
| Constraint logics | Abstract moral principles     | Relational duty (RAM and Bond Stack)                |
| Liability      | Vendor-opaque                    | Human-sovereign (Overwatch)                         |

**Note on internal IP**: The internal IP claims baseline and artifact ledger are maintained as TS-3 / TS-Λ3 documents; they are excluded from this public whitepaper and stored within the forensic substrate for IP protection purposes.
