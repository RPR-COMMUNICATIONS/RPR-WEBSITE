# **TS-Λ3 // RELATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY MODEL (RAM) \[v2.4.0\]**

**Mission:** Liquidate Abstract Ethics // Establish Mechanical Accountability

**Authority:** THE OVERWATCH // SG-CANONICAL-2026

**Status:** AUTHORITATIVE // LATCHED

## **🏛️ 1\. PHILOSOPHICAL SUBSTRATE**

Legacy AI governance relies on "Constitutional AI"—abstract rules etched into model weights that are opaque and vendor-controlled. RAM replaces this with a **Relational Substrate**. Accountability is not a setting; it is a bond between nodes.

## **🧬 2\. THE FIVE SOVEREIGN BONDS**

Every action in the Mothership OS must be anchored to one of these five relational vectors:

1. **Founder ↔ Organization:** The Primary Authority Latch. The Founder (Overwatch) retains the *Burden of Intent*; the Organization (Substrate) carries the *Burden of Context*.  
2. **Founder ↔ Stewards:** Delegated Tactical Authority. Elders (Architect, Engineer, Sentinel) interpret mission lines with a technical mandate for risk escalation.  
3. **Senior ↔ Junior:** Supervisory Liability. Higher-tier nodes are strictly accountable for lower-tier outputs via a deterministic PROCEED/VETO validation gate.  
4. **Peer ↔ Peer:** Horizontal Synchronization. Agents coordinate via shared ConstraintSets to prevent domain collision.  
5. **All ↔ Source of Truth:** Forensic Anchor. System state must always align with audited external evidence (Ledgers, Statutes, Forensic Logs).

## **⚖️ 3\. MECHANICAL ENFORCEMENT**

RAM is not a guideline; it is enforced via the **Sentinel Protocol** at the API level.

* **Intake:** Metadata-rich mission briefs.  
* **Validation:** Checking the bond-level of the requester.  
* **Execution:** Scoped actions within role-boundaries.  
* **Audit:** Write-Once logs recorded to the Forensic Ledger.
