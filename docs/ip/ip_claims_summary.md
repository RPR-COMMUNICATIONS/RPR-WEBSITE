## **🛡️ 1. PROTECTED NOVELTIES**

The following architectures are claimed as Trade Secrets and Prior Art belonging to **RPR COMMUNICATIONS, LLC**:

### **A. The External Law Engine (Sentinel Protocol)**

The method of governing LLM behavior through runtime-computed ConstraintSets and AgentContracts that reside *outside* the model's neural weights. This ensures that the "Law" of the organization remains independent of third-party model providers.

### **B. Relational Accountability Mathematics (Bond Stack)**

The five-bond matrix used to calculate liability and authority within a distributed Human-AI system. Unlike "alignment," this system uses relational duty (Founder ↔ Org, Founder ↔ Stewards, etc.) as the primary metric for system stability.

### **C. The Vertical Reasoning Plane (C4 Spatial Stack)**

The hierarchical L0–L4 visual and logical stack (Temporal → Sovereign → Reasoning → Execution → Product). This architecture maintains a "Living Digital Twin" state across multi-agent sessions, preventing agent context-blindness.

## **📑 2. EVIDENCE & PROVENANCE**

* **WORM Ledger:** All design documents and architectural schemas are hashed (SHA-256) and recorded in the Firestore WORM substrate.
* **Point of Origin (POO):** Initial cryptographic anchors and commits were finalized on the Singapore Node axis (asia-southeast1).
* **Authorship:** Strictly attributed to THE OVERWATCH via verified Identity Handshake and verified through corporate Git signatures.
