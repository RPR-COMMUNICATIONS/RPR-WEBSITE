                "body_p1": "Every system wanted me to learn its language, its menu, its rules. Every \"solution\" added another dashboard, another login, another way to lose the thread. The work was human and messy, but the software expected everyone to think like a developer.",
                "body_p2": "When I first reached for AI, it was pure necessity. I needed a way to see the whole picture instead of stitching it together in my head at midnight. Perplexity became my mentor: it researched faster than I could, remembered more than I could, and forced me to name the real limits and trade‑offs I was actually facing.",
